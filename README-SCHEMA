The spraytan schema looks like the following (prefix_name-field_name):

		bill-state
		bill-state
		bill-chamber
		bill-session
		bill-bill_id
		bill-name
		bill-guid

		bill_version-bill
		bill_version-name
		bill_version-url

		sponsorship-bill_state
		sponsorship-bill_id
		sponsorship-bill_chamber
		sponsorship-bill_session
		sponsorship-sponsor_type
		sponsorship-sponsor_name

		action-bill
		action-chamber
		action-text
		action-date
		
		

Records will be appended to "/output/folder/<pluralized_prefix>.csv".   
All fields are optional-ish.  Multiple records on one page can be 
expressed as a group named as the plural prefix of the type.  i.e.:

Examples:

		{
			"actions": [{
				"bill": "<selector>",
				"chamber": "<selector>",
				"text": "<selector>",
				"date": "<selector>"
			}]
		}


		{
			"action-bill": "<selector>",
			"action-chamber": "<selector>",
			"action-text": "<selector>",
			"action-date": "<selector>"
		}
		
		
		{
		 	"bill_version-bill": "<selector>",
		 	"bill_version-name": "<selector>",
		 	"bill_version-url": "<selector>",
			"action-bill": "<selector>",
			"action-chamber": "<selector>",
			"action-text": "<selector>",
