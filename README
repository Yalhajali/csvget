Spraytan is a crawler for the Sunlight Labs 50-state project.  It takes JSON-formatted parselets ( see http://github.com/fizx/parsley/tree/master and http://parselets.com ) as input.

The spraytan schema looks like the following (prefix_name-field_name):

    bill-state
    bill-chamber
    bill-session
    bill-bill_id
    bill-name
    bill-guid

    bill_version-bill
    bill_version-name
    bill_version-url

    sponsorship-bill_state
    sponsorship-bill_id
    sponsorship-bill_chamber
    sponsorship-bill_session
    sponsorship-sponsor_type
    sponsorship-sponsor_name

    action-bill
    action-chamber
    action-text
    action-date
    
    links  [any pages that should be spidered next]
    
Records will be appended to "/output/folder/<pluralized_prefix>.csv".   
All fields are optional-ish.  Multiple records on one page can be 
expressed as a group named as the plural prefix of the type.  

Example usage:

    spraytan --output-folder=./data --parselet=arizona-bills.json --parselet=arizona-sponsors.json http://azleg.gov/Bills.asp

Example parselets style:

    {
      "actions": [{
        "bill": "<selector>",
        "chamber": "<selector>",
        "text": "<selector>",
        "date": "<selector>"
      }]
    }


    {
      "action-bill": "<selector>",
      "action-chamber": "<selector>",
      "action-text": "<selector>",
      "action-date": "<selector>"
    }
    
    
    {
      "bill_version-bill": "<selector>",
      "bill_version-name": "<selector>",
      "bill_version-url": "<selector>",
      "action-bill": "<selector>",
      "action-chamber": "<selector>",
      "action-text": "<selector>",
      "action-date": "<selector>"
    }
